# Gravitational waveforms numerical simulation using post-Newtonian approximation equations, odeint for binary black hole system (July 25, B'lore)

## A simple exercise in modelling the inspiral of two compact objects i.e. black holes as they approach each other. 
It's a scientific programming demonstration of essentially what interferometers like LIGO and VIRGO do when the detect graviational waves (ripples in spacetime)
